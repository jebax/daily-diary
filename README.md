# Daily Diary Application!

This is a mini project completed independently. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete diary entries with a title and body. This full-stack project will use Sinatra and Ruby for front end and model, and PostgreSQL for the back end database.

## Domain model diagram

Here is a diagram I sketched to represent the domain model for this project: including representations of the client, controller, model, database, and view. This diagram shows examples of two functions for the diary app: listing entries, and adding a new entry.
